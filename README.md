# Photo Stat 
## About the Project
PhotoStat is intended to be a web-based AI to solve introductory hypothesis tests (z-tests and t-tests of Normal distributions) by inserting an image of a word problem or typing out the question. 

## Functionalities:
- Website with a simple interface to take/insert an image of a word problem or type out the question
- Option to take a picture of the word problem
- Option to upload a picture of the word problem
- Option to type out the word problem
- Allow users to view a step-by-step process of the hypothesis test
- Option to copy the solution to the clipboard or save it to a file
- View more information about the AI regarding its reliability (%) and the project 


## Tasks
- [ ] Add a way to process the image into text 
- [ ] Train a model to extract core data (e.g. mean, standard deviation, etc.) from the problem
- [ ] Train a model to perform the hypothesis test
- [ ] Allow users to view a step-by-step process of the hypothesis test
- [ ] Allow users to copy the solution to the clipboard
- [ ] Allow users to save the solution to a file
- [ ] Allow users to share the solution with others
- [ ] Create a website for the project
- [ ] Connect the AI to the website
